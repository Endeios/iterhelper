# iteration helpers

Personal project for keeping my iteration helpers, like my favorite "collection equal" method
that checks for equality and size, or more specifically checks that
given a collection A and a collection B, for each element in A , there is at least 1 element in B that is equal to the element and that the collections are the same size. You should check for null on your own :P
